# Workshop 211021

## workshop material 

- in order to follow along, please download github repo as zip file [https://github.com/nils-holmberg/sfac-r/archive/refs/heads/main.zip](https://github.com/nils-holmberg/sfac-r/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
- unzip repo file and find it in rstudio, demo will be held using [https://rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) by uploading zip file here

## install libs

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
install.packages("bookdown")
install.packages("rsconnect")
#install.packages("bslib")
#library(rmarkdown)
#library(bookdown)
```

## test rmarkdown

- we are going to use rmarkdown to render a single Rmd document, setwd() to sfac-r-main/web/bkd/workshop

```{r, eval=F}
#setwd("/cloud/project/sfac-r-main/web/bkd/workshop")
rmarkdown::render('document1.Rmd', output_format='all', output_dir='./')
#rmarkdown::render('document2.Rmd', output_format='all', output_dir='./')
```

- the output formats are specified in the yaml header of the Rmd file, you can preview the result by opening the output file
- when using docx output, we can use a reference document that will determine the styling of the output (could be useful for journal article templates ?)

## test bookdown

- bookdown is build on top of rmarkdown, and its primary function is to handle multiple Rmd files and render them as a coherent output document
- now we are going to try to render a collection of Rmd files as a book, the original bookdown demo can be found on github [https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo), but you can also change directory to sfac-r-main/web/bkd 

```{r, eval=F}
#setwd("/cloud/project/sfac-r-main/web/bkd")
bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', output_dir='./')
```

- the output formats are specified in the yaml header of the index.Rmd file, you can preview the result of any changes by opening the index.html file

## publish book

- if we have a git client and a github account, the book could now be published to github 
- however, we can also choose to publish to the web service [https://bookdown.org/](https://bookdown.org/) by creating a freemium account there

```{r, eval=F}
# rstudio connect package
rsconnect::accounts()
#rsconnect::connectUser(account="nils.holmberg", server="bookdown.org")
```

- the following commands can also be accessed more easily through the rstudio gui
- connect your r client to bookdown.org, rstudio connect while being logged in with web browser
- when publishing the bookdown file bundle, we need to stand in the correct working directory

```{r, eval=F}
#setwd("/cloud/project/sfac-r-main/web/bkd")
bookdown::publish_book(render="local", account="nils.holmberg", server="bookdown.org", name="sfac-r-bookdown")
```

## collaborate

- seems to only be available for shinyapps at this point, however web interface to rsconnect might have these functions available..

```{r, eval=F}
rsconnect::showUsers(account="nils-holmberg", server="shinyapps.io")
```

## troubleshoot

- instead of using the publish_book() function provided by the bookdown package, we can also try to deploy site using the rsconnect package to publish rendered Rmd output files

```{r, eval=F}
rsconnect::deployments(".")
#rsconnect::forgetDeployment(dryRun = TRUE)
#rsconnect::deploySite(account="nils.holmberg", siteName="sfac-r-bookdown", server="bookdown.org")
```

## deploy to github

```{r, eval=F}
```
