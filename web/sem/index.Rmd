## Introduction

Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) is a method that allows the researcher to test causal relationships between latent factors. It is similar to multiple linear regression and path analysis but is built on the foundation of a reflective measurement model and thus naturally controls for measurement error. SEM follows a two-step process with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) preceding testing of causal predictions. The current guide takes this perspective. Indeed, a researcher competent in CFA may find SEM somewhat of an anticlimax since the majority of the theoretical and practical mastery required occurs in the former rather than the latter.
